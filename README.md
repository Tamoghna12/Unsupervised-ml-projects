# Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised machine learning models are a type of machine learning that is used to discover patterns in data without the need for labeled data. This means that the model is not given specific examples of what the data represents, but instead it tries to find patterns and groupings within the data itself. In this article, we will explain the idea, key concepts, and methods of using unsupervised machine learning models in Python.

The idea behind unsupervised machine learning is to explore the structure of the data and identify patterns that are not immediately obvious. This is done by using clustering algorithms that group together similar data points based on their features. Unsupervised learning can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression.

The key concepts behind unsupervised machine learning are clustering algorithms, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. Clustering algorithms are used to group together similar data points based on their features. Feature extraction is the process of selecting and transforming the relevant features of the data to make it suitable for analysis. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in the data while preserving the important information.

The process of using unsupervised machine learning in Python involves several steps, including data preparation, model selection, model training, and evaluation. Data preparation involves cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure that it is suitable for analysis. Model selection involves choosing the appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm, such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering. Model training involves running the chosen algorithm on the data to identify patterns and groupings. Evaluation involves measuring the performance of the model and assessing whether it has achieved the desired outcome.

Let's take an example of using unsupervised machine learning in Python for customer segmentation. Suppose we have a dataset of customer purchase histories and we want to identify groups of customers that exhibit similar purchasing behaviors. The first step would be to prepare the data by cleaning and normalizing it. Next, we would select an appropriate clustering algorithm, such as k-means clustering. We would then train the model on the data to identify groups of customers that exhibit similar purchasing behaviors. Finally, we would evaluate the performance of the model by assessing whether it has successfully grouped together customers with similar purchasing behaviors.

In conclusion, unsupervised machine learning models are a powerful tool for discovering patterns and groupings within data. They are used to solve a wide range of problems, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression. Using unsupervised machine learning in Python involves several steps, including data preparation, model selection, model training, and evaluation. By understanding the key concepts and methods of unsupervised machine learning, we can use these models to gain insights and make informed decisions from our data.

In this project, we performed an unsupervised machine learning analysis and EDA on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. We explored the dataset, 
visualized the data using scatter plots and histograms, scaled the features, and performed principal component analysis, K-means clustering, and 
hierarchical clustering.
From the results of our analysis, we can see that the dataset can be separated into two clusters, with most of the benign diagnoses 
in one cluster and most of the malignant diagnoses in the other cluster. However, there is still some overlap between the two clusters, 
indicating that additional features or more sophisticated machine learning techniques may be needed to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.


In the second section, we have performed a comparative analysis of three popular unsupervised machine learning models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. 
We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset for this analysis, which contains information about various features of breast cancer cells.

# Unsupervised-ml-projects
In this project, we performed an unsupervised machine learning analysis and EDA on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. We explored the dataset, 
visualized the data using scatter plots and histograms, scaled the features, and performed principal component analysis, K-means clustering, and 
hierarchical clustering.
From the results of our analysis, we can see that the dataset can be separated into two clusters, with most of the benign diagnoses 
in one cluster and most of the malignant diagnoses in the other cluster. However, there is still some overlap between the two clusters, 
indicating that additional features or more sophisticated machine learning techniques may be needed to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.


In the second section, we have performed a comparative analysis of three popular unsupervised machine learning models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. 
We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset for this analysis, which contains information about various features of breast cancer cells.
